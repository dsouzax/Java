Today, in the IT industry, Java is among the most popular languages out there which is being used for many years.
It is used in software development, mobile applications, and large systems development. 

This repository has been created with only one goal in mind, which is to get a good control over the language myself as well after having a short break with Java and try to help others to practice their skills too.
Each solution also contains the problem statement. Hopefully I will be able to upload a wide range of problems ranging from easy to more complicated ones.
